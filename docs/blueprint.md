# **App Name**: Derivify

## Core Features:

- Google Auth: User authentication via Google Auth to ensure secure access to the platform.
- Document Template Purchase: Allows users to purchase templates of proof of address documents such as kra returns, utility electricity bills, and affidavits. Other document types will also be available.
- Document Personalization: Users submit their personal details, which you then use to edit the purchased document templates. The filled template will serve as proof of address.
- Payment Processing: Payment gateway integration using Paystack to process payments for document template purchases.
- Order Tracking: Displays order status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed) to both the user and the admin, ensuring transparency.
- Deriv API Integration: Integration with the Deriv API to allow users to fetch and display their document verification status directly within the app. (Note: ensure API usage aligns with Deriv's terms).
- Referral System: A referral system where existing users can invite new users with a unique code. The referrer gets a bonus (20 ksh) in their wallet upon successful signup of the referee.  A user may only sign up once. The owner processes bonus withdrawals manually to mitigate fraud.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to convey a sense of sophistication and trust, suitable for financial transactions.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), providing a neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the primary content.
- Accent color: Vibrant blue (#2196F3), used for interactive elements and calls to action, drawing attention to key functionalities.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, offering a modern yet friendly feel suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use a set of simple, professional icons in a minimalist style. These should clearly represent the different types of documents and actions a user can take.
- Clean and intuitive design with clear sections for document selection, detail submission, and status tracking. The user interface should be uncluttered to make navigation easy.
